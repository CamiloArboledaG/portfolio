This week was good. At work, I fixed issues in the app I’m working on, and everything went fine.
<br />
<br />

I talked with some people about new projects or job opportunities that were offered to me, but I really need to improve
my English because I get very nervous in those situations.
<br />
<br />

In other words, this week I relearned the importance of focusing on my goals.
<br />
<br />

Also, I have a new idea for a project—an on-demand service platform. The main idea is to connect people who need
workers, such as painters, plumbers, electricians, etc., with professionals who offer those services.
<br />
<br />

I think it’s a good idea, and I will start working on it. First, I researched similar companies in Colombia and found a
few, but I believe I can do it better. Currently, these platforms only allow users to search for people and contact
them—nothing more.
<br />
<br />

So this time, I’m focusing on this idea. Maybe it will work, but I will give it a try.
<br />

Sincerely,
