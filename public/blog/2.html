In my current life, I try to improve many things, and one of them is my habits.
I try to read more books, improve my English, and exercise during the week.
<br />
<br />

But I think that in today’s world, these habits are being lost over time. People believe that these habits are good, and
they are right, but they don’t do anything to implement them in their lives.
I know that in this world, it’s hard because we have social media and other things that give us a lot of dopamine,
making us not want to do anything else.

<br />
<br />
So, what do we need to do to change and create a better world? Today, I woke up and tried to read a book, but it was
hard because I had my phone in my pocket. Hearing it vibrate made me pick it up and check social media.

<br />
<br />
But all of these are just ideas, and I know that I need to focus on myself rather than on others. However, focusing only
on myself is difficult because I try to be a good person for my family, a good worker, and good to myself.
Some days, I wake up and don’t feel like doing much—I just want to sleep and relax.

<br />
<br />
But deep down, I know I need to change. I need to do many things because I want to become the best version of myself.
And I try.

<br />
<br />
This Sunday post is a message to myself—to wake up every day and try. Try a lot or just a little, but try, because every
day is a new step forward. I am 24 years old, and life is only one. I want to be the best at everything I do, for myself
and for my people.

<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
